## Import data set, EDA and data cleaning

```{r}
library(stats)

library(readr)
data <- read_csv("E:/Sumedha(important)/4th Year 1st Sem/Statistics/ST 405 - Multivariate methods II/project/Algerian_forest_fires_dataset_UPDATE.csv", 
                 skip = 1)
#View(data)
problems()

new_data <- data[-c(123, 124), ]

#View(new_data)
# Assuming your dataset is stored in 'data', check the structure
str(new_data)
head(new_data)

# Check for missing values
sum(is.na(new_data))

# Remove rows with any missing values
new_data<- na.omit(new_data)
# Check for missing values
sum(is.na(new_data))

```

**Convert char into numerical data**

```{r}
library(car)

library(dplyr)
new_data <- new_data %>%
  mutate_at(vars(FFMC,DMC,DC,ISI,BUI,FWI), as.numeric)



new_data <- new_data %>%
  mutate_at(vars(Temperature, RH,Ws,Rain), as.numeric)

# Check the class and structure of the data frame
str(new_data)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(new_data, aes(x=Temperature, col=Classes)) + geom_density()
```

```{r}
ggplot(new_data, aes(x=Ws, fill=Classes)) + geom_histogram() + facet_wrap(~Classes) + ggtitle("Fired or not with wind speed")


```

**Summary of the data set**

```{r}
summary(new_data)
xtabs(~Classes, data = new_data)
#str(new_data)


```

```{r}
sd_data<-new_data[, c("Temperature", "RH","Ws","Rain","FFMC", "DMC","DC","ISI","BUI","FWI")]
sd_data <-apply(sd_data,2,scale)

```

**Extract the two multivariate sets of variables**

```{r}
Weather <- new_data[, c("Temperature", "RH","Ws","Rain")]
FWI_compo <- new_data[, c("FFMC", "DMC","DC","ISI","BUI","FWI")]

```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
library(CCA)

ggpairs(Weather)

ggpairs(FWI_compo)

```

```{r}
library("CCA")
correl <- matcor(Weather, FWI_compo)
img.matcor(correl, type = 2)
```

**Correlations**

```{r}
# correlations
matcor(Weather, FWI_compo)
```

**Canonical correlation Analysis**

```{r}

#Canonical correlation
cc1 <- cc(Weather, FWI_compo)

# display the canonical correlations
cc1$cor


```

**Canonical coefficients**

```{r}
# raw canonical coefficients
cc1$xcoef

```

```{r}
cc1$ycoef
```

***The raw canonical coefficients are interpreted in a manner analogous to interpreting regression coefficients i.e., for the variable FFMC, a one unit increase in FFMC leads to a 0.0464 decrease in the first canonical variate of set 2 when all of the other variables are held constant. FWI leads to a 0.002871 increase in the dimension 1 for the FWI_Compo set with the other predictors held constant.***

***Next, we will use compute to compute the loadings of the variables on the canonical dimensions (variates). These loadings are correlations between variables and the canonical variates.***

```{r}
# compute canonical loadings
cc2 <- comput(Weather,FWI_compo,cc1)

# display canonical loadings
cc2[3:6]
```

***The above correlations are between observed variables and canonical variables which are known as the canonical loadings. These canonical variates are actually a type of latent variable.***

#### ***In general, the number of canonical dimensions is equal to the number of variables in the smaller set; however, the number of significant dimensions may be even smaller. Canonical dimensions, also known as canonical variates, are latent variables that are analogous to factors obtained in factor analysis.***

***For this particular model there are four canonical dimensions of which only the first two are statistically significant. For statistical test we use R package \"CCP\".***

**TESTS**

```{r}
library(CCP)
# tests of canonical dimensions
rho <- cc1$cor
## Define number of observations, number of variables in first set, and number of variables in the second set.
n <- dim(Weather)[1]
p <- length(Weather)
q <- length(FWI_compo)

## Calculate p-values using the F-approximations of different test statistics:
p.asym(rho, n, p, q, tstat = "Wilks")
```

**wilk lambda =0.2197308,F=18.452,d.f=24 : p\<0.0001.Here we reject the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between the two sets of variables,and can conclude that two sets of variables are dependent.**

**same as second, third and fourth canonical variate pair is correlated(All the P values are lower than 0.001).Therefore All four canonical variate pairs are significantly correlated and dependent on one another.**

```{r}
p.asym(rho, n, p, q, tstat = "Hotelling")
p.asym(rho, n, p, q, tstat = "Pillai")
p.asym(rho, n, p, q, tstat = "Roy")

```

**Estimates of Canonical Correlation**

```{r}
# Get the squared canonical correlations
squared_canonical_correlations <- cc1$cor^2

# Print the squared canonical correlations
print(squared_canonical_correlations)
```

70.54% of the variation in U1 is explained by the variation in V1 ,15.87% of the variation in U2 is explained by the variation in V2 and 9.68% of the variation in U3 is explained by the variation in V3 but only 1.80% of the variation in U4 is explained by V4.

this first one is very high canonical correlation and implies that only first one canonical correlation is important.

**Standardized canonical coefficients**

```{r}
# standardized psych canonical coefficients diagonal matrix of Weather sd's
s1 <- diag(sqrt(diag(cov(Weather))))
s1 %*% cc1$xcoef

# standardized acad canonical coefficients diagonal matrix of acad FWI_Compo's
s2 <- diag(sqrt(diag(cov(FWI_compo))))
s2 %*% cc1$ycoef
```

**consider the variable FFMC , a one standard deviation increase in reading leads to a 0.66 standard deviation decrease in the score on the first canonical variate for set 2 when the other variables in the model are held constant.**
