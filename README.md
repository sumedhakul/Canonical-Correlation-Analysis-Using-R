# Canonical Corerelation Analysis Project
## 1. Introduction
Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a way of measuring the linear relationship between two 
multidimensional variables. It finds two bases, one for each variable, that are optimal with 
respect to correlations and, at the same time, it finds the corresponding correlations. In other 
words, it finds the two bases in which the correlation matrix between the variables is diagonal 
and the correlations on the diagonal are maximized. The dimensionality of these new bases is 
equal to or less than the smallest dimensionality of the two variables. An important property of 
canonical correlations is that they are invariant with respect to affine transformations of the 
variables. This is the most important difference between CCA and ordinary correlation analysis 
which highly depend on the basis in which the variables are described. CCA allows us to 
summarize the relationship into a lesser number of statistics while preserving the main facts of 
the relationships. CCA is a dimension-reduction technique.
## 2. Objectives
The objectives of a Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) project are typically focused on 
understanding the relationship between two sets of variables and identifying the underlying 
patterns and associations between them. Here are the main objectives of this project:
1. Exploring Associations (determine if there are any significant relationships between two 
sets of variables)
2. Dimension Reduction
3. Finding a common structure (discover the common underlying structure between the two 
sets of variables)
4. Identifying key variables (identify which variables from each set contribute the most to 
the canonical correlations)
